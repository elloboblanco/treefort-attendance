# Treefort Schedule Aggregator

## About
This project is a simple `create-react-app` deployed to Amazon S3. It has a singular purpose, to query the Treefort public API for schedule and event data, then aggregate it into a table that shows "planned attendance" counts. In othe words it attempts to figure out how many people plan to attend each event based on public (and anonymous) schedule data.
